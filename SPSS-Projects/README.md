## SPSS Output Analysis Summary

The Week 8 SPSS output presents comprehensive frequency distributions and cross-tabulation analyses from a survey of 2,000 respondents. Key findings include:

### Demographic Distribution
- **Gender**: Nearly equal distribution (Female 32.7%, Male 35.2%, Other 32.2%)
- **Education**: Balanced across levels (Bachelor's 20.8%, Diploma 19.6%, High School 19.3%, Master's 20.3%, PhD 20.1%)
- **Awareness**: Slightly skewed toward low awareness (High 33.2%, Low 35.7%, Moderate 31.2%)

### Key Relationships
1. **Education-Satisfaction**:
   - Higher education correlates with increased satisfaction (Master's/PhD show 42% satisfaction vs 34-38% for lower education levels)
   - Dissatisfaction is consistent across education levels (~40-44%)

2. **Awareness-Satisfaction**:
   - High awareness respondents show highest satisfaction (38.4%)
   - Low awareness correlates with highest dissatisfaction (43.5%)

3. **Age-Satisfaction**:
   - Seniors (53.3% of sample) show balanced satisfaction/dissatisfaction
   - Youth show highest dissatisfaction (43.8%) and lowest satisfaction (35.7%)

### Notable Findings
- The "awareness gap" is particularly striking, suggesting service communication/education may be as important as service quality itself
- Education appears to moderate but not eliminate dissatisfaction
- Youth dissatisfaction may warrant targeted interventions
