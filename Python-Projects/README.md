## ðŸ“œ Projects

### 1. [Conflict Escalation Prediction in Kenya Using Machine Learning](Kenya_Conflict_AI_Model.ipynb)
- **Description:** Developed a machine learning model to predict conflict escalation in Kenya using historical data (2020â€“2024). The project aimed to analyze conflict patterns and provide actionable insights for policymakers.
- **Key Steps:** 
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers, encoding categorical variables).
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including distribution analysis and correlation heatmaps.
  - Model training using RandomForestClassifier.
  - Evaluation metrics (classification report, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC score).
