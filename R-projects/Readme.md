# ðŸ“Š Week 10 Titanic EDA Project

This project explores the Titanic dataset using R to uncover survival patterns through data visualization and statistical analysis.

**Tools:** R, tidyverse, ggplot2, VIM, corrplot  
**Key Steps:**  
- Data loading and inspection  
- Missing values analysis  
- Grouped bar plots for survival by class and gender  
- Scatterplots for age vs fare colored by survival  
- Correlation matrix for numerical variables  

**Key Findings:**  
- Females and higher-class passengers had better survival rates.  
- Younger passengers with higher fares showed slightly improved survival chances.  
- Weak correlation between age and fare, moderate correlation between SibSp and Parch.  

**Outputs:** Visualizations and summary statistics highlighting survival trends.
