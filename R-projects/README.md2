# 📊 Week 2 R Project – Statistical Analysis & Visualization

This project demonstrates the use of **R programming** for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and visualization.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The Week 2 project focuses on applying core R skills to analyze a dataset, summarize patterns, and communicate findings through clear visualizations and statistical outputs. It builds on principles of reproducible analysis using RMarkdown.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
- **Software:** R (RStudio)
- **Libraries:** `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `readr`, `summarytools`
- **Methods:** Data import, cleaning, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and chart creation.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Week2_Analysis.R` — Main R script for data processing and analysis.
- `Week2_Dataset.csv` — Dataset used in this project.
- `Week2_R_Project_.html` — Full HTML report with code, output, and visualizations.
- `Week2_Report.pdf` — Concise PDF summary of key findings.

## 📊 Key Steps
1. **Data Import & Cleaning** – Loaded CSV data, handled missing values, standardized column names, and formatted variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Summary statistics, histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to explore trends and outliers.
3. **Statistical Analysis** – Computed measures of central tendency, correlation coefficients, and basic inferential tests.
4. **Visualization** – Created professional plots using `ggplot2` for patterns and comparisons.

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Identified significant relationships between key variables (replace with your actual variables).
- Detected outliers that could influence statistical results.
- Provided actionable recommendations for deeper analysis in future weeks.
